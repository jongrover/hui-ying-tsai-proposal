        <h1>Hassenfield Children’s Hospital</h1>
        <h2>Shadow Boxes Project Proposal</h2>
        <p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
        <p>I am proposing 3 installations, one on each floor for the Hassenfield Children’s Hospital Shadow Boxes project.</p>
        <p>I have 15 years experience working as an interdisciplinary art professional. With my extensive hands on experience in art and design, I have produced many works in various mediums and  styles customized for different audiences.</p> 
        <p>My proposed project uses mixed media to create miniature mechanical merry go rounds that display fantasy scenes that re-imagine familiar places from New York’s cityscape. Each shadow box will be constructed with slightly different materials but in the same art style and mechanism.</p>
        <p>Included in the proposal are the following materials:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><a data-scroll href="#project_examples">3 project descriptions and sketches</a></li>
          <li><a data-scroll href="#past_work">Past work samples</a></li>
          <li><a data-scroll href="#resume">Resume</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The estimated cost per shadow box ranges from 7500 to 12000 USD depending on the materials and production method.</p>
        <p>The dimension and installation method can be adjusted to best showcase the artworks within the space. I am very excited about this opportunity to create whimsical and imaginative works for children. I will be honored to help turn  Hassenfield Children’s Hospital into a friendly environment for visitors.</p> 
        <p>I am very happy to discuss the content and style of the art works and am flexible about the final display set up.</p>

        <h1>Ground Fl. NY Harbor</h1>
        <h2>Water Tower Goes Round and Round</h2>
        <p>Marine creatures secretly turn the water tower into their playground! I want to make a mechanical miniature merry go round inside a water tower. The project is in a 1x1x1 cubic feet space that is half embedded in the wall with curved glass. The piece will have motor in the center that actually operates the carousel with LED light design that can be viewed 360 degrees.</p> 
        <p>The main animals are sculpted with polymer clay, with fabrics, acrylic paints, beads, gold leaf, and metals as needed. The carousel structure will be constructed with wood and the mechanical parts will be constructed with metals. The top of the water tower will be stained thin metal. The center of the carousel will have mirrors to create viewing depth to the piece. </p>

        <h1>4th Fl. Central Park</h1>
        <h2>Central Park Zoo Animals’ Subway Ride</h2>
        <p>Riding the subway are the widely adored animals of the Central Park Zoo. In the foreground red panda and grizzly bear snuggle with each other as snow monkeys pile up in another seat! How adorable!  The excitemnt is raises as the viewer simultaneously witnesses scenes from within the train in the foreground as well as seeing the train from afar traveling on a track through the background. This displays two perspectives of space into a singular moment. In the background the train rolls past the iconic Delacorte Music Clock of the central park zoo, as well as many other familiar New York City landmarks.</p>
        <p>The project is in a 1x1x1 cubic foot space that is half embedded into the wall with a curved glass. The piece will be constructed with a motor in the center that operates the carousel. With LED lights embedded into the carousel that can be viewed 360 degrees. Each set of seats is backed with a window that allows viewers to peer through beyond to the scenes outside the train.</p>
        <p>The animals are sculpted with polymer clay, with fabrics, faux fur, acrylic paints, beads, gold leaf, and metals. The carousel structure will be built with wood and the mechanical parts will be built with metals.</p>

        <h2>5th Ave. Pets Fashion Show</h2>
        <p>Pets in the city have their mini fashion show on 5th avenue! I want to make a mechanical miniature merry go round that showcases the pet’s fashion. The project is in a 1x1x1 cubic feet space that is half embedded into the wall with a curved glass. The piece will have motor in the center that actually operates the carousel with LED light design that can be viewed 360 degree.</p>
        <p>The main animals are sculpted with polymer clay, with fabrics, acrylic paints, beads, gold leaf, and metals as needed. The carousel structure will be constructed with wood and the mechanical parts will be constructed with metals. The center of the carousel will have mirrors to create viewing depth to the piece. The city scape in the center will also be made with polymer clay and acrylic paints to create 3D depth.</p>
