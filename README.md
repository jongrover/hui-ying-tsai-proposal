# Hui Ying Tsai Proposal

To Whom It May Concern:

I am proposing 3 installations, one on each floor for the Hassenfield Children’s Hospital Shadow Boxes project. 

I have 15 years experience working as an interdisciplinary art professional. From my extensive hands on experience in art and design, I have produced many works in various mediums and  styles customized for different audiences. 

My proposed project uses mixed media to create miniature mechanical merry go rounds that
display fantasy scenes that re-imagine familiar places from New York’s cityscape. Each shadow box will be built with slightly different materials but in the same art style and mechanism.

Included in the proposal are the following materials:
1. 3 project descriptions and sketches 
2. Past work samples
3. Resume

The estimated cost per shadow box ranges from 7500 to 12000 USD depending on the materials and production method. 

The dimension and installation method can be adjusted to best showcase the artworks within the space. I am very excited about this opportunity to create whimsical and imaginative works for children. I will be honored to help turning hospital into a friendly environments for the visitors.

I am very happy to discuss the content and style of the art works and am flexible about the final display set up.
